# Analyzing Hacker News posts
This was a guided project as part of DataQuest's curriculum on using Python for Data Analysis.
The dataset file, a csv, was too large to upload to GitHub (~50mb), but it is [accessible on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts).
More details about the analysis are available in the analysis.
